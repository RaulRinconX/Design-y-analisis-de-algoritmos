## What to find

In the following repository, you will find different graph algorithms. This can be divided into the following groups: elementary algorithms, shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.

## Elementary Algorithms
- BFS
- DFS
- Topological Sort (DFS)
- Strongly Connected Components (two DFS)

## Shortest Paths
- Dijkstra
- Bellman Ford
- Floyd Warshall

## Minimum Spanning Trees
- Kruskal
- Prim
